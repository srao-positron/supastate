# Pattern Detection Implementation Plan

## Goal
Build a comprehensive pattern detection system that discovers rich patterns across 6000+ memories and 1800+ code entities BEFORE designing the UX.

## Phase 1: Cron Job for Continuous Processing

### 1.1 Create Background Processing Function
```typescript
// supabase/functions/pattern-processor/index.ts
- Process memories and code in batches of 100
- Track progress with checkpoints
- Handle both initial backfill and incremental updates
- Run every 5 minutes via cron
```

### 1.2 Checkpoint System
- Track last processed timestamp for each pattern type
- Store in `pattern_processing_checkpoints` table
- Resume from last checkpoint on each run

## Phase 2: Implement All Pattern Detectors

### 2.1 Learning Patterns
- Detect research sessions
- Identify knowledge acquisition patterns
- Track learning progressions
- Keywords: learn, understand, study, research, explore, tutorial, documentation

### 2.2 Refactoring Patterns
- Detect code improvement cycles
- Identify technical debt areas
- Track refactoring sessions
- Keywords: refactor, improve, optimize, clean, restructure, reorganize

### 2.3 Architecture Patterns
- Detect system design discussions
- Identify architectural decisions
- Track design evolution
- Keywords: architecture, design, pattern, structure, system, component

### 2.4 Problem-Solving Patterns
- Detect investigation sequences
- Identify solution discovery
- Track problem resolution time
- Keywords: why, how, investigate, solve, solution, approach

## Phase 3: Temporal Pattern Detection

### 3.1 Session Detection
- Group memories by time proximity (< 30 min gaps)
- Create SessionSummary nodes
- Detect session types: debugging, learning, building

### 3.2 Pattern Evolution
- Track how patterns change over time
- Detect pattern transitions (e.g., learning → building)
- Identify recurring patterns

### 3.3 Productivity Patterns
- Time-of-day analysis
- Day-of-week patterns
- Session duration patterns

## Phase 4: Semantic Clustering

### 4.1 Embedding-Based Clustering
- Use OpenAI embeddings (already in data)
- DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering
- Create SemanticCluster nodes

### 4.2 Topic Detection
- Extract common themes from clusters
- Name clusters automatically
- Track cluster evolution

### 4.3 Cross-Entity Clustering
- Cluster memories and code together
- Identify conceptual groups
- Build topic maps

## Phase 5: Memory-Code Relationships

### 5.1 Direct References
- Detect when memories mention code files
- Extract file paths from memory content
- Create REFERENCES relationships

### 5.2 Semantic Similarity
- Compare memory and code embeddings
- Create RELATED_TO relationships
- Threshold: cosine similarity > 0.8

### 5.3 Temporal Proximity
- Link memories to code changed nearby in time
- Create CONTEMPORANEOUS relationships
- Window: ±1 hour

### 5.4 Conceptual Linking
- Use LLM to identify conceptual relationships
- Create IMPLEMENTS, DISCUSSES relationships
- Batch process with GPT-4

## Implementation Order

1. **Cron Job Setup** (2 hours)
   - Create pattern-processor function
   - Set up Supabase cron trigger
   - Test with small batches

2. **Pattern Detectors** (4 hours)
   - Implement all keyword-based patterns
   - Create pattern-specific queries
   - Test on existing data

3. **Temporal Patterns** (3 hours)
   - Implement session detection
   - Create time-based groupings
   - Analyze productivity patterns

4. **Semantic Clustering** (4 hours)
   - Implement clustering algorithm
   - Create cluster management
   - Test cluster quality

5. **Memory-Code Relationships** (3 hours)
   - Implement all relationship types
   - Create relationship queries
   - Validate relationships

## Success Metrics

After implementation, we should have:
- 100% of memories and code processed
- 10+ different pattern types discovered
- 50+ semantic clusters identified
- 1000+ memory-code relationships
- Rich temporal patterns across days/weeks

## Next Steps After Pattern Discovery

Once we have rich patterns:
1. Analyze what patterns users find most valuable
2. Design UX around actual discovered patterns
3. Build interfaces that surface insights naturally
4. Create pattern-aware search and navigation
