# Unified Search System - Action Plan

## Executive Summary

We're building a unified search system that combines memory search and code search into a single, intelligent interface. This system will understand the relationships between memories and code, providing rich, contextual results that help users (both humans and LLMs) find information more effectively.

## Key Innovations

### 1. **Relationship-Aware Search**
- Finds memories that discuss specific code
- Finds code that was written during specific conversations
- Shows patterns across both domains

### 2. **Context Expansion**
- Previous/next memory chunks for full context
- Related code files and functions
- Temporal relationships (what was happening at the same time)

### 3. **LLM-Optimized**
- Special endpoints for LLM consumption
- Structured responses with direct answers
- Context-aware result formatting

### 4. **Intelligent Query Understanding**
- AI-powered intent analysis
- Automatic strategy selection
- Natural language queries

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1: Foundation
- [ ] Create unified search API structure
- [ ] Implement search intent analyzer
- [ ] Build core search strategies (semantic, temporal, pattern-based)
- [ ] Set up result merging and ranking system

### Week 2: Memory Search Enhancement
- [ ] Implement context expansion (prev/next chunks)
- [ ] Add conversation thread retrieval
- [ ] Create pattern-based search
- [ ] Build temporal search with recency scoring

### Week 3: Code Search Integration
- [ ] Migrate existing code search logic
- [ ] Add semantic search for code
- [ ] Implement code-memory relationship search
- [ ] Create cross-domain result merging

### Week 4: LLM Features
- [ ] Build LLM-specific search endpoint
- [ ] Implement answer generation
- [ ] Create structured response formatting
- [ ] Add search strategy explanation

### Week 5: UI Implementation
- [ ] Create unified search page
- [ ] Build rich result cards
- [ ] Implement context navigation
- [ ] Add filtering and facets

### Week 6: Polish & Launch
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Add caching layer
- [ ] Create migration plan from old search
- [ ] Documentation and examples

## Key API Endpoints

### 1. Unified Search
```
POST /api/search/unified
- Searches across memories and code
- Returns rich, contextual results
- Supports filtering and pagination
```

### 2. LLM Search
```
POST /api/search/llm
- Optimized for LLM consumption
- Provides direct answers when possible
- Returns structured data
```

### 3. Context Expansion
```
GET /api/search/context/{id}
- Expands context for any result
- Returns related entities
- Provides navigation options
```

## Technical Requirements

### Neo4j Enhancements
1. **Vector Indexes**: Already have embeddings, need to optimize indexes
2. **Relationship Traversal**: Optimize queries for REFERENCES_CODE, DISCUSSED_IN
3. **Pattern Matching**: Leverage Pattern nodes for smart grouping

### New Components Needed
1. **Search Orchestrator**: Coordinates multiple search strategies
2. **Intent Analyzer**: Uses LLM to understand query intent
3. **Context Expander**: Fetches additional context for results
4. **Result Merger**: Combines results from different sources

### Performance Targets
- Search latency: < 300ms
- Context expansion: < 100ms
- LLM response: < 1s

## Migration Strategy

### For Code Search Users
1. Add banner announcing unified search
2. Show related memories in existing code results
3. Gradually migrate to unified interface
4. Maintain backwards compatibility

### For Memory Search Users
1. Enhance with code relationships
2. Add cross-domain search capabilities
3. Improve context navigation

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- Search response time
- Result click-through rate
- Context expansion usage
- Cross-domain search adoption

### Qualitative
- User feedback on result quality
- LLM integration effectiveness
- Time to find information
- Discovery of unknown relationships

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (This Week)
   - Set up search orchestrator framework
   - Create intent analyzer using OpenAI
   - Begin implementing search strategies

2. **Short Term** (Next 2 Weeks)
   - Complete core search functionality
   - Build LLM endpoints
   - Start UI development

3. **Medium Term** (Next Month)
   - Launch beta version
   - Gather user feedback
   - Optimize performance
   - Complete migration

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Performance**: Start with caching, add progressive loading
2. **Complexity**: Build incrementally, test each component
3. **Migration**: Keep old endpoints, gradual transition
4. **User Adoption**: Clear communication, obvious benefits

## Conclusion

This unified search system will transform how users interact with their knowledge base, making it easier to find information, understand relationships, and leverage the full power of the connected data we've built. By combining memories and code into a single search interface, we're creating a more intuitive and powerful way to access information.
